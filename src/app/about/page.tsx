      <h2>Why did I pick Enlisted vehicles as a subject?</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve sunk more hours into Enlisted than I'd like to admit, and I’ve developed an unhealthy love for armored warfare. From awkwardly driving a BT-7 into a ditch to heroically ramming a Panther with a T-60, I’ve done it all—and now I want to share that pain and glory with you.
      </p>

      <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
      <p>
        This is your one-stop tank shop for all things armored in Enlisted. Whether you're deciding if the Pz. IV is worth grinding or just want to flex your knowledge in team chat, this guide breaks down stats, tactics, and raw opinions about every iron beast in the game.
      </p>

      <h2>So, why did you actually choose this subject?</h2>
      <p>
        Look—calling it “research” lets me play Enlisted and avoid responsibility. Plus, I genuinely wanted to contribute to the community with something more useful than another "top 5 tanks" YouTube video with dubstep intros.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        New players trying to make sense of all the grind. Veterans trying to optimize their loadouts. Or maybe just someone who wants to know if the BA-11 is a meme or a monster. You’re all welcome here.
      </p>

      <h2>Any hidden goals?</h2>
      <p>
        Besides global armored dominance? Nope. Just here to help. And maybe justify my next premium squad purchase to myself.
