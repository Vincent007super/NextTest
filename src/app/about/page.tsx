      <h2>Why did I pick Enlisted vehicles as a subject?</h2>
      <p>
        I am a huge fan of the game Enlisted, and I wanted to create a guide
        for the armored vehicles in the game. I wanted to share my knowledge
        and help others understand the vehicles better.
      </p>

      <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
      <p>
        This website is a guide for the armored vehicles in the game Enlisted.
        It includes information about the vehicles, their stats, and how to
        use them effectively in the game.
      </p>

      <h2>So, why did you actually choose this subject?</h2>
      <p>
        Because I then get to dive deep into the game's mechanics and can
        disguise it as "For work".
