        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h2>Why did I pick Enlisted vehciles as a subject?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a huge fan of the game Enlisted, and I wanted to create a guide
          for the armored vehicles in the game. I wanted to share my knowledge
          and help others understand the vehicles better.
        </p>
        <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
        <p>
          This website is a guide for the armored vehicles in the game Enlisted.
          It includes information about the vehicles, their stats, and how to
          use them effectively in the game.
        </p>
        <h2>So, why did you actually choose this subject?</h2>
        <p>Because I then get to dive deep into the game's mechanics and able to disguise it as "For work".</p>
